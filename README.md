# MS2Deepscore model conversion to Java.
Scripts for converting a MS2Deepscore model to a TorchScript model for compatibility with Java

These scripts are used for creating a model that can be run in Java from MZMine. 
The notebooks are used for creating the models and for creating test results, to validate correct predictions in java.
For info about running MS2Deepscore from MZMine: https://mzmine.github.io/mzmine_documentation/module_docs/group_spectral_net/molecular_networking.html#algorithm-ms2deepscore

# Running
This is an extension of MS2Deepscore: https://github.com/matchms/ms2deepscore 
You will need to install ms2deepscore (and its dependencies) to run these scripts.
